# dcx-comp-html

HTML mockups to implement django-comments-xtd comp example site without
external CSS or UI frameworks.

There are three directories:
 * only-desktop: My first approach was thought only for desktop. Which was a wrong idea, as I should have think on Mobile First.
 * mobile-first: This is my second attempt. I don't discard the previos. But I should have started this way. So there will be a third attempt to mix the two.
 * responsive: This is the hopefully last approach, combining the two previous approaches.

Serve statically from within the repository with:

    $ python3 -m http.server 8000
