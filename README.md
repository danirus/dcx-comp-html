# dcx-comp-html

HTML mockups to implement django-comments-xtd comp example site without
external CSS or UI frameworks.

There are two directories:
 * only-desktop: I started designing only for desktop. Wrong idea.
 * responsive: This is the second attemp combining mobile and desktop.

## Run any of the three static sites

Switch to any of the previous mentioned directories and run the server:

    $ python3 -m http.server 8000
